        A friend who has dyslexia described to me how she experiences reading. She <em>can</em> read, but it
        takes a lot of concentration, and the letters seems to "jump around".

    <p>
        I remembered reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typoglycemia">typoglycemia.</a>
        Wouldn't it be possible to do it interactively on a website with Javascript? Sure it would.

            Dyslexia is characterized by difficulty with learning to read fluently and with accurate
            comprehension despite normal intelligence. This includes difficulty with phonological awareness,
            phonological decoding, processing speed, orthographic coding, auditory
            short-term memory, language skills/verbal comprehension, and/or rapid naming.
        </p>

        <p>
            Developmental reading disorder (DRD) is the most common learning disability. Dyslexia is the
            most recognized of reading disorders, however not all reading disorders are linked to dyslexia.

            Some see dyslexia as distinct from reading difficulties resulting from other causes, such
            as a non-neurological deficiency with vision or hearing, or poor or inadequate reading
            instruction. There are three proposed cognitive subtypes of dyslexia (auditory, visual and
            attentional), although individual cases of dyslexia are better explained by specific underlying
            neuropsychological deficits and co-occurring learning disabilities
            (e.g. attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, math disability, etc.).
            Although it is considered to be a receptive language-based learning disability in the research
            literature, dyslexia also affects one's expressive language skills. Researchers at MIT found that
            people with dyslexia exhibited impaired voice-recognition abilities.

    <h2 align="center"> About Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Web accessibility refers to the inclusive practice of removing barriers that prevent interaction with, or access
        to websites, by people with disabilities.
        When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, all users have equal access to information and
        functionality.

        For example, when a site is coded with semantically meaningful HTML, with textual equivalents provided for
        images and with links named meaningfully,
        this helps blind users using text-to-speech software and/or text-to-Braille hardware. When text and images are
        large and/or enlargeable,
        it is easier for users with poor sight to read and understand the content. When links are underlined (or
        otherwise differentiated) as well as colored,
        this ensures that color blind users will be able to notice them. When clickable links and areas are large, this
        helps users who cannot control a mouse with precision.
        When pages are coded so that users can navigate by means of the keyboard alone, or a single switch access device
        alone, this helps users who cannot use a mouse or
        even a standard keyboard. When videos are closed captioned or a sign language version is available, deaf and
        hard-of-hearing users can understand the video.
        When flashing effects are avoided or made optional, users prone to seizures caused by these effects are not put
        at risk. And when content is written in plain
        language and illustrated with instructional diagrams and animations, users with dyslexia and learning
        difficulties are better able to understand the content.
        When sites are correctly built and maintained, all of these users can be accommodated without decreasing the
        usability of the site for non-disabled users.
